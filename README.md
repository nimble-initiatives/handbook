# Getting Started

## Expectations
Getting started at Nimble Initiatives can be overwhelming. There are a lot of little details, a number of big tasks, you’re learning a new job and new coworkers, and you’re likely doing all these things while working remotely. Your buddy are here to help. If you don’t know how to set up your machine (or why you’re setting up something on your machine!), please ask. There is no set time period for most training periods, but most people are up to speed in about 3 months.

## Your Buddy
Even when you know who does what, it’s still nice to have a work buddy to ping when you don’t know where to turn or when you want to chat. So we set up a Buddy system. When you start, you’ll be assigned a buddy. They’ll introduce themselves, and they’re totally willing to point you in the right direction when you need it. Of course, everyone is available to help, but it’s nice to have a dedicated best work friend.

## Setting Up Your Machine
Your buddy helps you with day-to-day questions you might have, but someone on our Ops team will help you set up all the accounts you need to work at Nimble Initiatives. Your buddy will set up a Linear team dedicated to your onboarding called "Welcome, [your name]!". When you start, you’ll have access to that team in Linear.
