# Our Rituals
We love to have focused work time and we believe that the best work is done early in the morning.

## Nimble Afternoon
The Nimble Afternoon is where we go through our individual progress since the last team check-in, each team member can share their work, celebrate success, and spark questions for discussion.

## Collaborate on a shared meeting agenda
Any team member can add to the backlog before or during the meeting, making it easier for everyone to raise issues. The team meeting agenda becomes an opportunity to ask questions, get feedback and collaborate.

As the time goes on between check-in meetings, team members can always jump into [Linear](https://linear.app/nimble-initaitives/team/NIM/active) and add backlog items â€“ giving them the chance to store a question and get it resolved later, rather than forgetting about it.
