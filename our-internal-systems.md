# Our Internal Systems

## Enpass
For secure passwords, notes and so forth we use Enpass. An Enpass vault is synced and always up to date with the latest info.

## Sentry
We track programming exceptions on Sentry. When a customer hits a "Oops, something went wrong!" screen, that means thereâ€™ll be an entry in Sentry explaining to programmers why they saw that screen. Keeping the exceptions under control and monitored is primarily the responsibility of the OPS team.
